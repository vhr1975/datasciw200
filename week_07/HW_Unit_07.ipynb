    "\n",
    "- All calculations need to be done in the classes (that includes any formatting of the output)\n",
    "- Name your classes exactly as written in the problem statement\n",
    "- Do NOT make separate input() statements.  The classes will be passed the input as shown in the examples\n",
    "- The examples are using the '>>>' as the command entered into a Jupyter coding cell with the example output shown below it. Your program will be run on other tests not just the example provided.\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your classes output the same information\n",
    "- Answer format is graded - please match the examples\n",
    "- Inputs to classes and methods do need to be validated or checked where the problem or examples specifically state to check for inputs. Otherwise, you can assume that the correct input will be sent as shown in the examples.\n",
    "- Comments in your code are strongly suggested but won't be graded\n",
    "- This homework is mostly auto-graded. The blank code blocks are the auto-grading scripts - please do not delete these!\n",
    "- Your code needs to be written in the #Your Code Here blocks or it wont be graded correctly.\n",
    "- `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are discussed in Unit 8. "

    "\n",
    "Please design two classes in this notebook as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Please create a class called **PlayingCard**. This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"rank\" that takes a value of \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\", or \"A\"<br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"suit\" that takes a value of \"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\". (If you don't know how to make these characters you can cut and paste from this block)<br>  \n",
    "- An __init__ function that:\n",
    "    -  Accepts as parameters a specific rank (as a string) and suit (as a string).\n",
    "    -  Gives an appropriate response when a rank or suit is not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Please create a class called **Deck**.  This class should have: <br>\n",
    "- An attribute, \"cards\", that holds a list of PlayingCard objects. <br>\n",
    "- An __init__ function that: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - By default stores a full deck of 52 playing card (with proper numbers and suits) in the \"cards\" list. Each cards will be  of the class PlayingCard above<br>\n",
    "    - Allows the user to specify a specific suit (of the 4 - \"♠\" \"♥\" \"♦\" or \"♣\").  In this case, the program should only populate the deck with the 13 cards of that suit.\n",
    "    - After the cards object is initialized, call the \"shuffle_deck()\" function (below).<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A \"shuffle_deck()\" function that randomly changes the order of cards in the deck.<br>\n",

    "    - If you import random, please import it at the top of your block instead of inside the class / methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"deal_card(card_count)\" function that removes the first card_count cards from the deck and returns them as a list.<br>\n",
    "    - Make sure this function gives an appropriate response when the deck is out of cards.\n",

    "The following figure depicts Galton's box, a game in which marbles are dropped through N rows of pins.  In row 0, there is one position a marble can be in (labeled 0), in row 1, there are two positions (labeled 0 and 1), and so forth.  Each time the marble bounces from one row to the next, there is a 50% probability it bounces left and a 50% probability it bounces right. \n",

    "- ```insert_marble``` - This method should accept a Marble instance and sets its position to position 0, row 0.\n",
    "- ```time_step``` - This method should cause all Marbles in Galton's box to bounce to the next row, dropping left or right with equal probability.  When a marble reaches row N-1 at the bottom of the box, it should not move any more.  Note that you should simply allow marbles to occupy the same position (instead of working out a system to prevent a Marble from entering a position if another Marble is already there).\n",

    "\n",
    "In a particular board game, there is exactly one row and it comprises N spaces, numbered 0 through N - 1 from left to right. There are also N marbles, numbered 0 through N - 1, initially placed in some arbitrary order. After that, there are two moves available that only can be done one at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switch: Switch the marbles in positions 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Rotate: Move the marble in position 0 to position N - 1, and move all other marbles one space to the left (one index lower).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to arrange the marbles in order, with each marble i in position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Write a class, **MarblesBoard**, to represent the game above. The class should be initialized with a particular sequence of Marbles.  \n",
    "- Write an ```__init__``` function that takes a starting sequence of marbles (the number of each marble listed in the positions from 0 to N - 1). (Notice in the sequence all the marbles are different numbers and are sequential numbered but not in order!)\n",
    "- Next, write switch() and rotate() methods to simulate the player's moves as described above. \n",
    "- Write a method, is_solved(), that returns True if the marbles are in the correct order, False otherwise.\n",
    "- Additionally, write ```__str__ and __repr__``` methods to display the current state of the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your class should behave like the following example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board = MarblesBoard((3,6,7,4,1,0,8,2,5)) \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 6 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "6 3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.rotate() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 6 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "7 3 4 1 0 8 2 5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Write a second class, **Solver**, that actually plays the MarblesGame. \n",
    "- Your class will take a MarblesBoard in its initializer. \n",
    "- Write a solve() method that repeatedly calls the switch() and rotate() methods of the given MarblesBoard until the game is solved. You should print the state of the board after each move.  Additionally, print out the total number of moves at the end. Remember, you can only do one switch or one rotate per step!\n",
    "- You are to come up with your own algorithm for solving the marbles game. Before you write your solve() method, you may want to practice solving some small versions of the marbles game yourself.\n",
    "- Your Solver should strive to make the algorithm reasonably efficient and strive to be the fastest runtime. (Points are awarded based on algorithm efficiency!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board2 = MarblesBoard((1,3,0,2))\n",
    ">>> solver = Solver(board2)\n",
    ">>> solver.solve()\n",
    "1 3 0 2 \n",
    "3 0 2 1 \n",
    "0 2 1 3 \n",
    "2 1 3 0 \n",
    "1 2 3 0 \n",
    "2 3 0 1 \n",
    "3 0 1 2 \n",
    "0 1 2 3 \n",
    "total steps: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be interested to know that your program is a variation of a well-known sorting algorithm called bubble sort.  Bubble sort would normally be used on a list of items, not on a rotating track, but adapting your algorithm to this setting would be straight-forward."
