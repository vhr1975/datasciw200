# UC Berkeley Data Science W200: Introduction to Data Science Programming

This repository contains my coursework for UC Berkeley’s Data Science W200 (MIDS program). The course introduces foundational programming concepts and practical skills for data science using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and essential data science libraries.

## Course Summary & Learning Objectives

- Develop proficiency in Python programming for data science.
- Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Work with data structures, functions, and modules.
- Use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis and reporting.
- Practice data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- Gain experience with version control (Git/GitHub) and collaborative workflows.

## Major Projects & Assignments

### Project 1: Car Loan Schedule Calculator
- **Description:**  
	Designed and implemented a terminal-based Python application to calculate and display an amortized car loan schedule. The project emphasized OOP, with at least six custom classes, and required user interaction and data-centric output.
- **Key Skills:**  
	Object-oriented design, user input handling, modular code, command-line interfaces, pandas/numpy usage, and documentation.

### Weekly Assignments

#### Week 1: GitHub & Environment Setup
- Practiced using GitHub for version control.
- Set up Python virtual environments and explored basic configuration.

#### Week 2: Python Scripting Fundamentals
- Wrote scripts to obtain user input, perform calculations, and output results.
- Learned to run and manage Python scripts from the command line.

#### Week 3: Data Structures & Control Flow
- Practiced with lists, tuples, dictionaries, loops, and conditionals.
- Built small programs to manipulate and display data.

#### Week 4: Algorithmic Thinking
- Used for/while loops, list comprehensions, and pseudo-coding.
- Explored algorithm complexity and problem-solving strategies.

#### Week 5: Functions & Recursion
- Defined and used functions, including recursive functions.
- Practiced error handling with try/except statements.

#### Week 6: Code Style & Modularization
- Read and applied PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Created and imported custom modules; used command-line arguments.

#### Week 7: Object-Oriented Programming
- Designed and implemented Python classes and class interactions.
- Practiced encapsulation, method design, and attribute management.

#### Weeks 9–12: Data Analysis & Visualization
- Imported, cleaned, and transformed real-world datasets.
- Used pandas for data wrangling and matplotlib for visualization.
- Practiced advanced Python (map/filter, comprehensions, lambda functions).
- Explored exploratory data analysis and reporting.
