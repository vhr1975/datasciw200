    "\n",
    "- In each code block, do NOT delete the ### comment at the top of a cell (it's needed for the auto-grading!)\n",
    "- Limited user input validation and error checking is encouraged on this assignment. Each question below will indicate the type of input that you can expect. (for example, if the question states the input will be an integer, you can expect the user to input an integer and do not need to check to ensure it is an integer versus a float or a string)\n",
    "- Adding comments in your code is strongly suggested but won't be graded.\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your code outputs the same information.\n",
    "- If you are stuck on a problem or do not understand a question - please come to office hours or ask questions to the class Google group (please don't post your code though). If it is a coding problem send a private email to all of the instructors at: mids-python-instructors@googlegroups.com\n",
