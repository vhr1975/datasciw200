    "Please see my answer below:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The PEP is a great best practice guide for Python developers getting started. Python is a dynamic language and following the guide do and donâ€™t are important. This has been accepted as the standard guide for Python code. In order to write consistently easy to read and understand code the guidance of the PEP is invaluable. By following not only these best practices of indentation, line breaks, file encoding, import statements and comment guidance you code will be easy to read and understand. A consistency layout in blocks of code, modules and functions will help the original developer but also other developers. This industry standard written code will be easy to and understand now and later by anyone who needs to fix, reuse or extended the original code now but more importantly days, months or even years later. \r\n",
    "To help a beginner Python developer, I feel using tools when writing code will only enhance the code being written. The number one tool that will help any beginner or new Python developer must be the IDE or integrated development environment. The IDE will not only check but it can also enforce syntax rules. There are third party and community created IDE plugins that will help in the develop, testing, deploying and visualizing the Python code. There are also online code beautifiers available that will add to the code readability and standards. All these tools will help a beginner adhere to the PEP coding standards. \r\n",
    "It is also very important to constantly refer to the guide. As the Python language and standard evolve over time the guidance will also adjust. To keep your coding practice up to date with the latest standards it very important to refer the PEP guide. \r\n"

    "\r\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes a Scrabble rack as a command-line argument and prints all \"valid Scrabble English\" words that can be constructed from that rack, along with their Scrabble scores, sorted by score. \"valid Scrabble English\" words are provided in the data source below. A Scrabble rack is made up of 2 to 7 characters.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Below are the requirements for the program:\r\n",
    "- This needs to be able to be run as a command line tool as shown below (not an input statement!)\r\n",
    "- Name the python file: `scrabble.py`\r\n",
    "- Make a separate module named `wordscore` which contains at a minimum a function called `score_word`. This `score_word` function will take each word and return the score (scoring dictionary is described below). Import this function into your main `scrabble.py` program. \r\n",
    "- Allow anywhere from 2-7 character tiles (letters A-Z) to be inputted. \r\n",
    "- Do not restrict the number of same tiles (e.g., a user is allowed to input ZZZZZQQ).\r\n",
    "- Output the **total** list of valid Scrabble words that can be constructed from the rack as (score, word) tuples, sorted by the score and then by the word alphabetically as shown in the first example below.\r\n",
    "- Then output 'Total number of words:' and the total number.\r\n",
    "- You need to handle input errors from the user and suggest what that error might be caused by and how to fix it (i.e., a helpful error message)\r\n",
    "- Implement wildcards as either `*` or `?`. There can be a total of **only** two wild cards in any user input (that is, one of each character: one `*` and one `?`). Only use the `*` and `?` as wildcard characters. A wildcard character can take any value A-Z. Replace the wildcard symbol with the letter in your answer (see the second example below). \r\n",
    "- Wildcard characters are scored as 0 points, just like in the real Scrabble game. A two wildcard word can be made, should be outputted and scored as 0 points. \r\n",
    "  - In a wildcard case where the same word can be made with or without the wildcard, display the highest score. For example: given the input 'I?F', the word 'if' can be made with the wildcard '?F' as well as the letters 'IF'. Since using the letters 'IF' scores higher, display that score.\r\n",
    "- For partial credit, your program should take less than one minute to run with 2 wildcards in the input. For full credit, the program needs to run with 2 wildcards in less than 30 seconds.\r\n",
    "- Write docstrings for the functions and puts comments in your code.\r\n",
    "- You may only use the Python standard library in this assignment. However, any function in the standard library is allowed.\r\n",

If there is not an example of how to run the extra credit in this cell we will assume that you did not do the extra credit part!\r\n",

    "scores = {\"a\": 1, \"c\": 3, \"b\": 3, \"e\": 1, \"d\": 2, \"g\": 2,\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "#### Tips:\r\n",
    "- If you don't know what \"scrabble\" is or the basic background of the game please look it up online!\r\n",
    "- We recommend that you try to break down the problem into steps on your own before writing any code. Once you've scoped generally what you want to do, then start writing some code.  If you get stuck, go back to thinking about the problem rather than trying to fix lots of errors at the code level.\r\n",
    "- If you have questions on getting arguments from the command line, please review async video 6.17 and Drill 6.18.\r\n",
    "- If you keep getting stuck, then check out: https://wiki.openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge or https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g3yz5ljkzaAeQ-AgQR1Hofy8ZJ0jo25x/view?usp=sharing. This is where we got the idea for this assignment and it provides some helpful tips for guiding you along the way.  However, we would recommend that you try to implement this first before looking at the hints on the website.\r\n",
